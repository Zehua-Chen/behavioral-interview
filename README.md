## Tell Me About Yourself

I am currently a master student at Columbia looking for full time frontend
developer positions. My major is computer science and I am expected to graduate
in December 2022. I did my undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana
Champaign also in computer science.

Outside of work, I used to do some side projects in both frontend and game
development. However, at the moment, I focus on job searching.

## Weakness

When leading projects, I sometimes gave too much time to one person and forget
about the timeline of the entire project (ex. IOT Virtualization). I overcome
this by creating tasks to rid of dependencies (so progress can still be made).
Sometimes I would also assign delayed tasks to myself.
