# Financial Times

- Came across on Linkedin

# IXL Learning

Something I wish I had

- Fast feedback cycle
  - China: 1-2 days for homeworks to be corrected; new homeworks by then; no
    learning
  - USA: weeks of lecture before homework; forget everything by then
  - IXL offers ways for students to check progress; don't have to be Excel
    expert
- Tight integration
  - Khan academy: not integrated, more time
- Available to parents whose school do not use the system
  - No after school classes: expensive and exhausting
